## Epistates

Epistates is a Laravel rewrite of [Administrare](https://github.com/astrantialabs/administrare), a web application I developed during my previous internship at the Department of Labor and Social Services in Balikpapan, Indonesia. It is designed to streamline the management of an organization's office inventory.

> Epistates is currently a side-hobby project of mine. I'm working on it in my free time or when I'm bored, so it's not a priority. I'm also using it as a way to learn new things, so it's a bit of a mess. I'm trying to keep it as clean as possible, but it's still a mess.
